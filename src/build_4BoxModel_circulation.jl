# including and then running `build_3box_model(JLDfilePath)`
# will build the 4-box model and save it as JLDfilePath



#= The 4-box model is used because the code to build the PFD code requires
that the grid is organized in columns.
These are the indices of the 4-box model:

┌───────┬────────────────────────┐
│       │           2            │
│   1   ├────────────────────────┤
│       │                        │
├───────┤                        │
│       │           4            │
